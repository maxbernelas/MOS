MOS is an OS written for a STM32F103 microcontroller (which features an ARM
Cortex-M3 core). It is developed for fun and for self-learning purposes. It is
NOT intended to be optmized or portable, but focuses on being easily
understandable.

MOS is developed by Maxime Bernelas <maxime@bernelas.fr>.

Compiling instructions:
* MOS is designed to compile using a GNU toolchain able to produce code for
  ARM Cortex-M3 targets. Make sure you have one installed if you try to compile
  MOS
* Just run 'make' under the root directory and it should produce an executable
  binary named 'mos.bin'
* Enjoy !
